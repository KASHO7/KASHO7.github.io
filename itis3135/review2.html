        <ul>
            <li>The submission link leads to the correct page</li>
            <li>The scripts files and the images follow proper naming convention</li>
            <li>Design
                <ul>
                    <li>The site has contrast but the nav and sidebar being similar doesn't back it stand out.</li>
                    <li>The site does use a css file, but it is not in a separate folder.</li>
                    <li>The rest of the site follows the C.R.A.P principles well.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The page has header, footer, and main, but header and footer are not in separate files.
            </li>
            <li>Header has a h1 tag.</li>
            <li>Main does start with h2 and does not include brand name.</li>
            <li>The site has designed by on every page, does not have an slogan, which is understandable for this type of site.</li>
            <li>Page has footer but does not have menu for user's page, instead the menu is in the nav bar, but it does have html and css validation.</li>
            <li>Overall the site fulfills all most all of the requirements on the checklist, and is a great to look at.</li>
