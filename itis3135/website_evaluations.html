        <h3><a href="https://dribbble.com/">Dribbble</a></h3>
        <p>
          Dribbble.com is a global online hub for designers to showcase their
          creative work, connect with peers, and find inspiration.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Design: Clear contrast between the vibrant and colorful design shots
            and the clean, white background of the website. This contrast
            ensures that the design work stands out and grabs the user's
            attention.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition: Maintains a consistent grid layout for displaying design
            shots. Each design shot is presented in a rectangular container with
            uniform dimensions, creating a repetitive and organized structure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment: Navigation elements such as menus and buttons are
            horizontally and vertically aligned, ensuring a cohesive and
            user-friendly interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity: Comments and discussions related to a specific design
            shot are positioned in proximity to that shot.

          <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          Berkshire Hathaway's website is for investors and people curious about
          the company. It has details on the company, its money, resources for
          investors, and news about its many businesses.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contrast: Websites that use a wide range of colors inconsistently
            throughout their pages can appear chaotic and unprofessional,
            causing confusion for users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition: Inconsistent placement of navigation menus, logos, or
            buttons can make it challenging for users to navigate a website
            efficiently
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment: Does not fully utilize contemporary alignment techniques
            to create visually compelling layouts.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity: Websites that place too many elements in close proximity
            can overwhelm users and make it difficult for them to focus on
            important information.
