        <h2>Project: Financial Health Check</h2>
        <p>
          Our team conducted a thorough Financial Health Check for a leading
          financial institution. The audit revealed opportunities for cost
          savings, streamlined processes, and improved financial reporting
          accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outcomes included a 15% reduction in operating costs and enhanced
          transparency in financial reporting.

        <h2>Project: Internal Controls Enhancement</h2>
        <p>
          We collaborated with a manufacturing company to enhance its internal
          control systems. Our assessment identified weak points in the existing
          controls, and we implemented tailored solutions to strengthen the
          company's risk management framework.
        </p>
        <p>
          The results were a significant reduction in operational risks and
          improved overall organizational efficiency.
